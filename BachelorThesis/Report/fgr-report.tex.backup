\title{Estimation of $\mathbold{\gamma}$, \space $\mathbold{\pi^{0}}$ and $\mathbold{\eta}$ ratios in the photonic background in 
proton-proton collisions \\at $\mathbold{\sqrt{s} = 7}$ TeV with ALICE}

\abstract{The heavy-flavour production in pp collisions is an important testing ground for perturbative QCD, the field theory for the 
strong interaction. One way of measuring heavy-flavour hadrons is via the leptons originating from their decays. There are other sources 
of leptons which represent the background for their measurement. In this report the main sources of the background for the semileptonic 
decays are evaluated, for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ TeV. For this purpose the photonic method is used; it consists in calculating 
the invariant mass of an "inclusive" $e^{\pm}$, for which stringent cuts are required to be sure that its track belongs to an $e^{\pm}$,  combined with an "associated" one, 
for which only relaxed cuts are required to maximise the efficiency. Then the background is obtained subtracting the like-sign 
($e^{\pm}e^{\pm}$) distribution from the unlike-sign ($e^{\pm}e^{\mp}$) distribution; finally the quantitative contribution of 
the main sources are derived from a fit.}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{The quark-gluon plasma}

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) predicts that under extreme conditions of very high temperature
or baryo-chemical potential $\mu_{B}$, hadronic matter transits to a deconfined phase of matter called \textit{``quark-gluon plasma``}
(QGP), in which quarks and gluons are not bound in hadrons.\\

The QGP is thought to have permeated the universe for few $\mu s$ after the Big Bang. Experimentally, it can be created in 
ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\\
These collisions create a so called \textit{fireball} of interacting quarks and gluons above the critical temperature, 
which first reaches the thermal equilibrium, and then quickly expands and cools down. During the cooling starts the \textit{hadronization}, 
or rather quarks and gluons become again confined and form hadrons.\\
The last phases are the \textit{chemical freeze-out} and the \textit{kinetic freeze-out}, where, 
respectively, inelastic and elastic processes cease.

\subsection{Heavy-flavour production}
The production of hadrons which contain heavy quark (charm or beauty) is an important probe for the QGP. It happens exclusively 
through initial hard partonic scattering processes when the medium is more dense, because of their higher mass. Heavy quarks lose 
energy differently than the light quarks in the QGP. They are therefore a signature of the deconfinement, 
and their behaviour in the medium is useful to characterise the medium itself.\\
Hadrons carrying heavy-flavour can decay by weak interaction, through a \textit{''semileptonic decay``}, in which one lepton (and the 
corresponding neutrino) is produced in addition to one or more hadrons.\\
It is therefore important to estimate the background for these decays to quantify the heavy-flavour production. \\

The main sources for the photonic background are the photon conversions ($\gamma\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$) and the $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$
Dalitz decays ($X \rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}\gamma$)\footnote{X stands for $\pi^{0}$ or $\eta$ mesons}, which are the major contribution
for the low $p_{T}$ region (80\%\textdiv \space 95\%). \\
The aim of this study is to quantify the relative amount of those three sources, especially the ratio between photons and $\pi_{0}$ 
and $\eta$ mesons.

\section{Tracks selection}
\subsection{$e^{\pm}$ identification}
For this analysis MC data for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 7$ $TeV$ (LHC10f6a) have been used: they are generated with PYTHIA 6
and their behaviour in the detectors (ITS, TPC and TOF) has been simulated with GEANT 3\footnote{\textbf{GE}ometry \textbf{AN}d 
\textbf{T}racking package}.\\

The idea of this analysis method is to combine an "inclusive" $e^{\pm}$, whose track is surely related to an electron, 
with an "associated" $e^{\pm}$, for which less stringent cuts are required to maximise the efficiency.\\
The cuts applied to the reconstructed tracks, for "inclusive" and "associated" $e^{\pm}$, are shown in the following table:

\end{table}
Finally, using the MC truth information, only the tracks that really belong to $e^{\pm}$ are selected for both "inclusive" 
and "associated" $e^{\pm}$.

\subsection{Invariant mass analysis}

It is possible to reconstruct the mass of a particle from its decay products \\(in our case they will be $e^{\pm}e^{\mp}$, 
or equivalently $e^{\pm}e^{\pm}$), using the following relation:

\begin{align} 
\setlength{\jot}{12pt} 
m_{ee} &= \sqrt{(p_{1}+p_{2})^{2}} \\ \nonumber
&= \sqrt{(E_{1}+E_{2})^{2}-(\vec{p_{1}}+\vec{p_{2}})^{2}}. 
\label{mee}
\end{align}

The indices 1 and 2 stand for the two candidates and the energy is calculated from the mass of the daughter particles (in this case
\\$m_{e} =$ 0.511 MeV), because $E_{i}$ is not directly measured.

\section{Photonic background with MC truth information}
Using the MC truth it is possible to select every $e^{+}e^{-}$ pair which comes from one of the sources listed before, and then to 
obtain their invariant mass distributions.\\

The numbers of $\gamma$ conversions, \space $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ Dalitz decays, known from MC truth, are shown in the following table:

\begin{table}[htb]
\center
\caption{Amount of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs from the three sources, obtained from the MC truth distributions}\label{amount_MC}

  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{$n_{\gamma}/ n_{\eta}$} &
  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{9.94 $\pm$ 0.05} \\

  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{$n_{\gamma}/(n_{\pi^{0}}+n_{\eta})$} &
  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{1.035 $\pm$ 0.002} \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Invariant mass distributions}
Every measured particle is described by several parameters which determine its kinematic and track.\\
The initial observables, which describe the particle how it was originally created, are known from the MC truth.
From ESD\footnote{\textbf{E}vent \textbf{S}ummary \textbf{D}ata} it is possible to obtain the parameters after the interaction
of the particle with the material of the detectors,  and its track has been reconstructed from the measured information. 
The invariant mass distributions have been generated first with MC truth, then with ESD observables.\\ 
Thus we can notice how the distributions obtained with the reconstructed tracks of the particles are wider than the others,
due to the finite resolution of the detectors.\\
It is finally possible to put together the three contributions, that should represent the majority of the background (at least for 
$m_{ee} < m_{\eta}$), and fit the result with a parametric distribution, which summarises the three contributions.\\

\subsection{Fit functions}
\label{subsec:fit}

The parameterization is different for photon conversions and Dalitz decays.\\
For the first source an exponentially modified Gaussian distribution has been chosen, 
\begin{equation}
\frac{dN}{dm_{ee}}=N_{\gamma}\cdot e^{-\frac{(m_{ee}-M_{\gamma})^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}}+\Theta(m_{ee}-M_{\gamma})
e^{\frac{m_{ee}-M_{\gamma}}{\tau}}
\label{gaussexp}
\end{equation}

where $\Theta$ is the Heaviside function, which is defined equal to zero for $m_{ee} < M_{\gamma}$ and equal to 1 for 
$m_{ee} > M_{\gamma}$.\\

This function fits reasonably well because the invariant mass of a photon is not exactly zero, in fact the conversion can only happen
near to a nucleus, which transfers a fraction of his momentum. In addition for the reconstructed tracks it is necessary to take into 
consideration the finite resolution of the detectors.\\

For the Dalitz decays, instead, the \\Kroll-Wada distribution has been used
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{dN}{dm_{ee}} &=N_{X}\cdot\frac{2}{m_{ee}}B^{3/2}\sqrt{1-\frac{4(m_{e}/M_{X})^{2}}{(m_{ee}/M_{X})^{2}}}\times \\
&\times \Bigg\{1+\frac{2(m_{e}/M_{X})^{2}}{(m_{ee}/M_{X})^{2}}\Bigg\}\cdot F_{X}(m_{ee}^2) 
\label{kroll_wada}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $N_{X}$ is a normalisation factor, $m_{e}$ is the mass of an electron or a positron, $M_{X}$ the mass of the mother particle 
and 
\begin{equation}
B=(1+(m_{ee}/M_{X})^{2})^2-4(m_{ee}/M_{X})^{2}.
\label{kroll_wada}
\end{equation}
The Form Factor $F_{X}$ is different for every Dalitz decay. For the $\pi^{0}$ and the $\eta$ the expressions are 
\begin{equation}
\Bigg\{
\begin{array}{rl}
F_{\pi^{0}}(m_{ee}^2) = \frac{1}{(1-5.5\cdot m_{ee}^2)^{2}}\\
F_{\eta}(m_{ee}^2) = \frac{1}{(1-1.9\cdot m_{ee}^2)^{2}}
\label{formfactors}
\end{array}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[tb]
\center
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{Inv_mass_ESD.pdf}
\caption{Invariant mass distribution for $\gamma$ conversion, $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ Dalitz decays from MC truth with 
observables from ESD reconstructed tracks}
\label{ESDdist}
\end{figure}

In this analysis the parameters which should represent the mass of the mothers are not the real ones, but they have been fixed from the
fit performed to the distribution with all the three sources (selected with MC truth), with the observables calculated from the 
reconstructed tracks (Fig.\ref{ESDdist}). \\
In fact the distributions of the Dalitz decays cannot be properly described by the Kroll-Wada, due to the fact that some counts for 
low transverse momentum and low invariant mass are lost, because particles with low $p_{T}$ and $m_{ee}$ cannot reach the detectors.\\
This problem affects more the $\pi^{0}$ distribution than the $\eta$ one, because the $\pi^{0}$ meson has a lower mass (the real values 
are $m_{\pi^{0}} = 139.57$ MeV and $m_{\eta} = 547.85$ MeV).\\ 

The values of the parameters from the fit and the integrals of the single contributes are summarised in Tab.\ref{fit}.

\section{Photonic background without MC truth information}
In order to approach a realistic analysis strategy to be performed with real data, the MC truth information is ignored in this section.\\
Therefore every "inclusive" $e^{\pm}$ is combined to an "associated" $e^{\mp}$ and for each pair the invariant mass $m_{ee}$ is 
calculated to create the unlike-sign distribution, that contains both the photonic signal, and the combinatorial background. \\
Then every "inclusive" $e^{\pm}$ is paired to an "associated" $e^{\pm}$ for the like-sign invariant mass distribution. 
This one represents only the combinatorial background, that will be then subtracted from the unlike-sign distribution to obtain only 
the signal which we are interested in.\\In Fig.\ref{LSUS} the two distributions are shown: the red points belong to the 
unlike-sign distribution, the black ones to the like-sign.\\
For the like-sign distribution a normalisation was necessary, in fact not all the combinatorial background was subtracted.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\center
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{like-unlike_norm.pdf}
\caption{The invariant mass distribution of like-sign ($e^{\pm}e^{\pm}$) and unlike-sign ($e^{\pm}e^{\mp}$) combination.}

\end{figure}

\newpage

\begin{figure}[tb]
\center
\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{esd_comb.pdf}
\caption{The photonic background fitted with the template obtained from the MC truth}
\label{photonic}
\end{figure}

For every bin the ratio between the unlike-sign and the like-sign distribution has been calculated, and then linearly fitted starting 
from $m_{ee} >$ 0.3 $GeV/c^{2}$.
Every bin of the like-sign distribution has been then multiplied for the value of the line in the centre of the bin, to obtain the 
normalised distribution.\\

Once subtracted the like-sign distribution from the unlike-sign, the resulting photonic background has been fitted with the templates 
extrapolated from the MC truth in section \ref{subsec:fit}, as represented in Fig.\ref{photonic}.
The values of the parameters that should represent the masses have been fixed from the ones obtained from the previous fit (Tab. 
\ref{fit}).\\
The purpose of this method is therefore to obtain the same amount of $\gamma$, \space $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$, as known from the MC truth.
The integral of the three contributions and the relative ratios are shown in the following table:

\begin{table}[htpb]

\caption{Amount of $e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs from the three sources, obtained from the fit of the photonic background}\label{fit2}

  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{Integral of $\pi^{0}$ } &
  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{354000 $\pm$ 4000} \\
  \hline
  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{Integral of $\eta$ } &
  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{42000 $\pm$ 3000} \\
  \hline
  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{$I_{\gamma}/I_{\pi^{0}}$} &
  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{1.19 $\pm$ 0.02} \\
  \hline
  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{$I_{\gamma}/I_{\eta}$} &
  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{10.0 $\pm$ 0.8} \\
  \hline
  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{$I_{\gamma}/(I_{\pi^{0}}+I_{\eta})$} &
  \raisebox{0pt}[10pt][4pt]{1.07 $\pm$ 0.02} \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

As we can see the values obtained from the fit are comparable to the real ones known from the MC truth, within the statistical error.

\section{Conclusions and Outlook}
The goal was to determine the ratio between the contribution from photon conversions and from $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ Dalitz decays 
to the photonic background to the electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays.\\ 
It has been reached, although more precise results could be obtained fixing some details (for example the problem of higher masses).
The ratio between $\gamma$ and $\eta$ seems to be the best one to be considered, but it is only due to the large statistical error.
In fact the relative error for the number of $\eta$ is of 7.1\%, while for $\pi^{0}$ is 1.1\% and for $\gamma$ 1.4\%.\\ 
Therefore the ratio between photon conversions and all the contributes from Dalitz decays should be used.
Moreover we can notice that some counts from $\pi^{0}$ could be misidentified and contribute to the $\eta$ integral, as it is possible 
to observe from the fit performed to the MC truth distribution (Tab.\ref{fit}). The total number of Dalitz decays has not changed 
anyway.\\

The next step would be look into real proton-proton data, to see if the same ratio is found.
Finally the same study can be applied to Pb-Pb data, to verify that there is an excess of $\gamma$, which are supposed to be 
thermal photons originated by the fireball, which is only created in heavy ions ultra-relativistic collision.  
More information about this phenomenon can be found in the article \cite{Masciocchi:2011fu}.
